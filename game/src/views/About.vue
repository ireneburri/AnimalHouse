          <h1 class="pageTitle">How to Stay Healthy Around Pets</h1>
          <h2>Understand the Risks and Benefits of Pets</h2>
          <div>There are many health benefits of owning a pet.
            They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize.
            Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels.
            Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship.
            Most households in the United States have at least one pet.
          </div>
          <p>Studies have shown that the bond between people and their pets is linked to several health benefits,
            including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Decreased blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and
              symptoms of PTSD.
            </li>
            <li>Increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities; better cognitive function in older adults; and
              more opportunities to socialize
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Some people are at higher risk for diseases animals can carry</h2>
          <div>Children younger than 5 years old, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 years of age and older
            are more likely to get diseases spread between animals and people (also known as zoonotic diseases).
            Pregnant women are also at a higher risk for certain animal-related diseases.
            Before getting a new pet, keep the following in mind:
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Households with children younger than 5 years old should not have pet reptiles (turtles, lizards, snakes),
              amphibians (frogs, toads), or backyard poultry because of the risk of serious illness from harmful germs spread
              between these animals and young children.
            </li>
            <li>People with weakened immune systems should take extra precautions when choosing and handling pets.
              Talk to your veterinarian for help picking the best pet.
            </li>
            <li>Pregnant women should avoid adopting a new cat or handling stray cats, especially kittens.
              Cats can carry a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis—a disease that can cause birth defects.
              If you are pregnant, you do not need to give up your current cat, but you should avoid handling cat litter.
            </li>
            <li>Pregnant women should avoid contact with pet rodents to prevent exposure to lymphocytic choriomeningitis
              virus, which can cause birth defects.
              If you’re pregnant and have a pet rodent, avoid direct contact and have someone else clean its habitat.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Keep Your Pet Healthy</h2>
          <div>
            Whether you have a dog, cat, horse, parakeet, gerbil, bearded dragon, or other fun pet, providing regular,
            life-long veterinary care is important for keeping your pet and family healthy.
            Regular veterinary visits are essential to good pet health.
            Talk to your pet’s veterinarian about how to keep your pet healthy.
            Provide your pet with a good diet, fresh water, clean bedding, and plenty of exercise.
            Keep up with your pet’s vaccines, deworming, and flea and tick control.
            Some pets can carry ticks that can spread serious diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever to
            people.
            In areas with plague—including some rural areas in the western US—fleas can be a risk to both animals and their
            owners.
          </div>
          <p>By keeping your pet healthy, you help to keep yourself and your family healthy.
            Contact your veterinarian if you have any questions about your pet’s health or if you think your pet may be
            sick.</p>
